Dragonfly is a speech recognition framework. It is a Python package which offers a high-level object model and allows its users to easily write scripts, macros, and programs which use speech recognition.

It currently supports the following speech recognition engines: * Dragon NaturallySpeaking (DNS), a product of Nuance. * Window Speech Recognition (WSR), as included in Microsoft Windows Vista.

A sister project is the Dragonfly command-modules repository. This is a steadily growing collection of command-modules for controlling common programs and automating frequent desktop activities. This is the place to look if you want to use speech recognition to increase your productivity and efficiency. It also contains many examples, from simple to complex, of how to use the Dragonfly library.

# Documentation
The library's documentation is available for browsing online. Please refer to it for a more detailed overview of the Dragonfly library.

# Features
Dragonfly was written to make it very easy for Python macros, scripts, and applications to interface with speech recognition engines. Its design allows speech commands and grammar objects to be treated as first-class Python objects. This allows easy and intuitive definition of complex command grammars and greatly simplifies processing recognition results.

# Language object model 
The core of Dragonfly is based on a flexible object model for handling speech elements and command grammars. This makes it easy to define complex language constructs, but also greatly simplifies retrieving the semantic values associated with a speech recognition.

# Support for multiple speech recognition engines  
Dragonfly's modular nature lets it use different speech recognition engines at the back end, while still providing a single front end interface to its users. This means that a program that uses Dragonfly can be run on any of the supported back end engines without any modification. Currently Dragonfly supports Dragon NaturallySpeaking and Windows Speech Recognition (included with Windows Vista).

# Built-in action framework - Dragonfly contains its own powerful framework for defining and executing actions. It includes actions for text input and key-stroke simulation.

# Installation and Use
For detailed instructions on how to install and use Dragonfly, please refer to the library's documentation.
